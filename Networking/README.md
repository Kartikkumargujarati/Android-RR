# Networking
This Kotlin app is part of my series -  Android Rewind and Repeat. 

#### Features
This app shows a list of most starred Kotlin repositories in one fragment and a list of gists in another fragment.
Currently using the Retrofit2 library to make all the network requests. Implemented different operations like 
GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE using the Github's API to Get, Create, Update and Delete a Gist file.
This sample app follows MVP pattern.

#### 3rd Party Libraries Used:
- [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) / [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)
